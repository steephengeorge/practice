/*
We use the integers a, b, and n  to create the following series:
a+2^0 *b , a + 2^1 * b, ......a+2^n-1 *b

Print the series corresponding to the given a, b, n and  values as a single line of  space-separated integers.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, t, denoting the number of queries. 
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains three space-separated integers describing the respective a, b, n

Output Format

For each query, print the corresponding series on a new line. Each series must be printed in order as a single line of  space-separated integers.

Sample Input

2
0 2 10
5 3 5

Sample Output

2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046
8 14 26 50 98
